                That thin piece of plastic in your wallet feels like a modern
                invention, but the idea of paying without cash is over a century
                old. The journey from clunky metal plates to the contactless
                cards we use today is a fascinating story of convenience,
                technology, and a little bit of forgetfulness.
              </p>

              <h2>The Pre-Plastic Era: Charge Plates and Coins</h2>
              <p>
                Long before plastic, in the early 1900s, large department stores
                offered "charge-plates" and "charge-coins" to their wealthy
                customers. These were small metal tokens, often with a hole to
                fit on a keychain, embossed with the customer's account number.
                When making a purchase, a clerk would use the plate to imprint
                the customer's details onto a sales slip. It was a system built
                on trust and was limited to a single store.

              <h2>The "First Supper" and the Birth of the Credit Card</h2>
              <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-center md:gap-8">
                <div class="w-full md:w-2/3">
                  <p>
                    The modern credit card was born from an awkward moment. In
                    1949, a businessman named Frank McNamara was dining at a
                    restaurant in New York City when he realized he had
                    forgotten his wallet. The embarrassment sparked an idea: a
                    single card that could be used at multiple establishments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A year later, in 1950, he returned to the same restaurant
                    and paid with a small cardboard card, known as the
                    <strong>Diners Club Card</strong>. This event is famously
                    called the "First Supper." The Diners Club was a "charge
                    card," meaning the full balance had to be paid at the end of
                    the month. It was initially accepted at just 27 restaurants
                    in New York but quickly grew, laying the groundwork for the
                    universal credit card.

              <p class="italic text-gray-400 mt-8">
                The first Diners Club cards were made of cardboard. It wasn't
                until 1955 that the first plastic card was introduced.
              </p>

              <h2>Bank of America and the Rise of Revolving Credit</h2>
              <p>
                The next major leap came in 1958 when Bank of America launched
                the <strong>BankAmericard</strong>. Unlike the Diners Club card,
                this was the first successful general-purpose credit card that
                offered "revolving credit," allowing customers to carry a
                balance from month to month.
              </p>
              <p>
                To kickstart the program, the bank famously conducted the
                "Fresno Drop," where they mass-mailed 60,000 active, unsolicited
                BankAmericards to residents of Fresno, California. The
                experiment was chaotic, with high rates of fraud, but it proved
                the concept worked. The BankAmericard would later evolve and be
                renamed <strong>Visa</strong>.
              </p>

              <h2>The Debit Card: Direct Access to Your Money</h2>
              <p>
                The debit card has a slightly different origin, evolving from
                ATM cards. The first ATM was introduced in London in 1967. As
                banks began connecting their ATM networks in the 1970s and 80s,
                they realized the same technology could be used for
                point-of-sale purchases.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike a credit card, which is a form of loan, a debit card
                gives you direct access to the funds in your bank account. This
                concept of "pay now" became incredibly popular for everyday
                purchases, offering the convenience of a card without the risk
                of accumulating debt.
              </p>

              <h2>From Magnetic Stripes to Secure Chips</h2>
              <p>
                For decades, the magnetic stripe (magstripe) was the standard.
                Developed in the 1960s, it stored your account information on a
                simple magnetic strip. However, it was easy to copy, leading to
                widespread fraud.
              </p>
              <p>
                This led to the development of the EMV chip (Europay,
                Mastercard, and Visa). The microchip on your card creates a
                unique transaction code every time you use it, making it nearly
                impossible to counterfeit. This "Chip and PIN" or "Chip and
                Signature" system is now the global standard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, with contactless technology, we don't even need to insert
                our cards. A simple tap is enough. From metal plates to tapping
                our phones, the way we pay has changed dramatically, making it
                more important than ever to track our
                <span class="text-orange-500 font-semibold">කාසි</span> and
                understand where our money is going.
